  &quot;CoT&quot;: &quot;To answer this question, let&#x27;s break it down step by step:  \n1. identify the share of uninsured individuals aged 0-18 years in 2008: 1.2  \n2. identify the share of uninsured individuals aged 19-64 years in 2008: 3.7  \n3. calculate the difference between the share of uninsured individuals aged 19-64 years and the share of uninsured individuals aged 0-18 years in 2008: 3.7 - 1.2 = 2.5  \n4. determine if the share of uninsured individuals aged 19-64 years was more than double the share of uninsured individuals aged 0-18 years in 2008: 3.7 &gt; 2 * 1.2 (which simplifies to 3.7 &gt; 2.4)  \n5. conclude whether the statement is true based on the comparison: True  \nThe final answer is True.&quot;

  &quot;CoT&quot;: &quot;To answer this question, let&#x27;s break it down step by step:  \n1. identify the share in poverty for All households with less than a high school diploma: 26  \n2. identify the share in poverty for All households with a high school diploma: 13  \n3. determine the difference between the share in poverty for All households with less than a high school diploma and those with a high school diploma: 13  \n4. calculate the new share in poverty for All households with less than a high school diploma after a 5% increase: 26 + (5% of 26) = 26 + 1.3 = 27.3  \n5. determine the difference between the new share and those with a high school diploma: 27.3 - 13 = 14.3 which rounds to 14  \nThe final answer is 15%.&quot;
