  &quot;CoT&quot;: &quot;To answer this question, let&#x27;s break it down step by step:  \n1. identify the percentage of people aged 18-29 who think China will have about the same influence: 33  \n2. identify the percentage of people aged 65+ who think China will have about the same influence: 29  \n3. determine the difference between the percentage of people aged 18-29 and the percentage of people aged 65+ who think China will have about the same influence: 33 - 29 = 4  \n4. compare the calculated difference with 4%: The difference is exactly 4%, which is not greater than 4%.  \nThe final answer is b) False.&quot;

  &quot;CoT&quot;: &quot;To answer this question, let&#x27;s break it down step by step:  \n1. identify the percentage of adults who are Internet users among the uninsured: 79  \n2. identify the percentage of adults who are not Internet users among the uninsured: 21  \n3. Swap the two percentages: now the percentage of adults who are Internet users among the uninsured is 21, and the percentage of adults who are not Internet users among the uninsured is 79. Given the swapped values, the statement &#x27;Among adults without health insurance, a larger portion are not internet users compared to internet users&#x27; is True.  \nThe final answer is True.&quot;

  &quot;CoT&quot;: &quot;To answer this question, let&#x27;s break it down step by step:  \n1. identify the percentage of respondents who had &#x27;Great deal/fair amount of confidence&#x27; in Putin: 28  \n2. identify the percentage of respondents who had &#x27;Not much/no confidence&#x27; in Putin: 54  \n3. identify the percentage of respondents who said &#x27;Don&#x27;t know&#x27;: 18  \n4. determine the difference between the percentages for &#x27;Great deal/fair amount of confidence&#x27; and &#x27;Not much/no confidence&#x27;: 54 - 28 = 26  \n5. calculate the average of all three percentages: (28 + 54 + 18) / 3 = 33.33  \n6. compare each category to the average: &#x27;Don&#x27;t know&#x27; (18) is closest to the average of 33.33  \nThe final answer is 26, Don&#x27;t know.&quot;
