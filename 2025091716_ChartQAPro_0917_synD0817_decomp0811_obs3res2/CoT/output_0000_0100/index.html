  &quot;CoT&quot;: &quot;To answer this question, let&#x27;s break it down step by step:  \n1. identify the sex ratio for the fourth child and higher in 1994: 238  \n2. identify the sex ratio for the fourth child and higher in 2000: 168  \n3. identify the sex ratio for the fourth child and higher in 2002: 153  \n4. select the years where the sex ratio for the fourth child and higher is decreasing based on the identified ratios for 1994, 1996, and 1998: 1996, 1998  \n5. determine if the selected years show a continuous decrease in sex ratio for the fourth child and higher: Since 1996 and 1998 were identified as years with decreasing sex ratios and no other years were mentioned as increasing, the statement is supported by the data.  \nThe final answer is True.&quot;

  &quot;CoT&quot;: &quot;To answer this question, let&#x27;s break it down step by step:  \n1. identify the sex ratio for the first child in 1992: 106  \n2. select the years where the sex ratio for &#x27;First child&#x27; is less than 110: All provided years (1990, 1992, 1994) have a sex ratio less than 110  \n3. determine the sum of the last digits of the sex ratios for the selected years (1990, 1992, and 1994) across all categories: 15  \n4. calculate the sum of the last digits of the sex ratios for the first child in years where the sex ratio is less than 110: Since the provided sum includes all categories, we need additional details about the &#x27;First child&#x27; category alone; however, with the current information, the answer would be based on the provided sum of 15 which doesn&#x27;t directly address the &#x27;First child&#x27; category specifically.

  &quot;CoT&quot;: &quot;To answer this question, let&#x27;s break it down step by step:  \n1. identify the share of people agreeing with the statement &#x27;most people can be trusted&#x27; in Finland: 47.92  \n2. identify the share of people agreeing with the statement &#x27;most people can be trusted&#x27; in Spain: 29.01  \n3. determine half of the share of people agreeing with the statement &#x27;most people can be trusted&#x27; in Finland: 23.96  \n4. calculate the difference between this reduced level and the share in Spain: 23.96 - 29.01 = -5.05, but considering absolute difference, it is 5.05  \n5. round the difference between the hypothetical reduced trust level in Finland and the share in Spain: 5  \nThe final answer is 5.&quot;
