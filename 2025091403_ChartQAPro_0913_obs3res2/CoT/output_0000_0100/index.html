  &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;a) 15.9%&quot;,
  &quot;Cleaned_answer&quot;: &quot;d) 15.5%&quot;,
  &quot;CoT&quot;: &quot;To answer this question, let&#x27;s break it down step by step:  \n1. identify the child mortality rate estimated by UN IGME (2018): 15.4  \n2. identify the child mortality rate estimated by UN Population Division (2019): 14.22  \n3. determine the difference between the child mortality rate estimated by UN IGME (2018) and UN Population Division (2019): 1.18  \n4. swap the two original rates, ensuring the UN Population Division (2019) rate remains the lower one: The original rate 14.22 becomes 15.4 and 15.4 becomes 14.22. The identified sector remains consistent as there are only two rates  \n5. calculate the new child mortality rate if the UN IGME (2018) rate increases by 0.5%: 15.4 + (15.4 * 0.005) = 15.477, which rounds to 15.48 and the closest option is c) 15.45%  \nThe final answer is c) 15.45%.&quot;

  &quot;CoT&quot;: &quot;To answer this question, let&#x27;s break it down step by step:  \n1. identify the incidence in 2014: 1361  \n2. identify the prevalence in 2014: 573  \n3. determine the difference between the incidence and prevalence in 2014: 1360.75357 - 573.121189 = 788  \n4. observe if the majority of prevalence values between 2012 and 2014 fall within the 573 to 578 range: yes  \n5. check if the incidence value in 2014 is higher than the prevalence value in 2014: True  \nThe final answer is 788 False.&quot;

  &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;True&quot;,
  &quot;Cleaned_answer&quot;: &quot;False&quot;,
  &quot;CoT&quot;: &quot;To answer this question, let&#x27;s break it down step by step:  \n1. identify the mortality rate for Micronesia in 2000: 27  \n2. identify the sectors appearing in both Micronesia&#x27;s 2000 and 2005 mortality rates: mortality from non communicable diseases  \n3. evaluate if the mortality rate remained constant between 2000 and 2005: Since the subquestions do not provide the exact mortality rate for 2005, and there is no information suggesting it was the same as 2000, we cannot confirm constancy. Given the complex question asserts the statement is false, we conclude the mortality rate did not remain constant.  \nThe final answer is False.&quot;
